#Image Processing using OpenCV in Python

Digital image processing is the use of a digital computer to process digital images through an algorithm. 
As a subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image processing has many advantages over analog image 

# What is image processing?

As the name says, image processing means processing the image and this may include many different techniques until we reach our goal.
The final output can be either in the form of an image or a corresponding feature of that image.
This can be used for further analysis and decision making. But what is an image? An image can be represented as a 2D function F(x,y) where x and y are spatial coordinates.
The amplitude of F at a particular value of x,y is known as the intensity of an image at that point. If x,y, and the amplitude value is finite then we call it a digital image. 
It is an array of pixels arranged in columns and rows. Pixels are the elements of an image that contain information about intensity and color.
An image can also be represented in 3D where x,y, and z become spatial coordinates. Pixels are arranged in the form of a matrix. 
This is known as an RGB image

#ðŸ”… Task 4.1 Create image by yourself Using Python Code

#ðŸ”… Task 4.2 Take 2 image and combine it to form single image. For example collage

#ðŸ”… Task 4.3 ðŸ“Œ Take 2 image crop some part of both image and swap it.
